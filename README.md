# Link Prediction using DeepWalk and Node2Vec algorithm for Social Network Mining

This is my group project assignment 2 of COMP4332 Big Data Mining and Management in HKUST.

This project invloves using the DeepWalk algorithm and Node2Vec algorithm to predict the links.

You should see the following things in this repository:

* COMP4332 Project 2 source code.ipynb: the Jupyter Notebook
* COMP4332 Project 2 Report.pdf: the report for this project
* COMP4332 Project 1 and 2 presentation (Group 4).pdf: the presentation slide of this project
* pred.csv: the submitted link prediction on the testing dataset
* Project2_Social_Network_Mining_Spring2024.pdf: the description of this project
* data: the folder that contains the training dataset, the validation dataset and the testing dataset
* submission: the submission for this project

## How to run?

1. Upload the jupyter notebook and the data folder to the same directory on Google Drive
2. Open Google Colab and change the location path of the data files if necessary
3. Run all the code at once

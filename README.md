# Link Prediction using DeepWalk and Node2Vec algorithm for Social Network Mining

This is my group project assignment 2 of COMP4332 Big Data Mining and Management in HKUST.

This project invloves using the DeepWalk algorithm and Node2Vec algorithm to predict the links.

The research paper on DeepWalk: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.6652

The reserach paper on Node2Vec: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.00653

## How to run?

1. Upload the jupyter notebook and the data folder to the same directory on Google Drive
2. Open Google Colab and change the location path of the data files if necessary
3. Run all the code at once
